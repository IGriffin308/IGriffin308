My name is Ian and I have dedicated a year to programming. My journey commenced with a Bootcamp where I immersed myself in full-stack web development, mastering React and Node.js, while also delving into the Python stack.

Throughout my learning process, I've become proficient in crafting code that's not just functional but also clean and organized, with a keen eye on best practices and rigorous testing.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity, I'm committed to furthering my understanding of computer science. I actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and explore innovative coding techniques to enhance my skill set.
